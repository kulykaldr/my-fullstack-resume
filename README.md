## Usage

`package.json` provides four scripts for development, build, preview and deploy. The first three are associated with Vite. The script _deploy_ uses [push-dir](https://github.com/L33T-KR3W/push-dir) to push the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

In order to deploy the local changes you made:

```sh
# Clear working tree
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Before deploy"

# build project to dist directory
$ npm run build

# Use push-dir to push dist to gh-pages
$ npm run deploy
```
